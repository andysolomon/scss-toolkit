/*= @group Layout
---------------------------------------------------------------------- */

//  From Adaptive Web Design, http://easy-readers.net/
//
//  The @media declaration ensures that every medium gets typography and colour styles,
//  but only mediums which implement `screen` get the layout styles.
//
//  This has the added benefit of being ignored by older browsers (e.g., Netscape 4),
//  so if for any reasons the site is viewed by legacy browsers they just get basic, but accessible, styling.
